# Language Learning App
Super simple language flashcards app (less refined than "flashcards" repo)

# TODO:
- Clear the form after adding a new card
	- Possibly redirect to the homepage or sth
	- Show a modal informing that new card has been added
- Add "Delete" button to delete cards from the database
- Fix responsiveness when it comes to certain parts of forms
- Delete or do something with the search input at the navbar
- Properly handle the result of fetchAddCard in 'NorwegianAddX.jsx' for X in ['Adjective', 'Noun', 'Verb']
- Split form inputs into a separate file for 'NorwegianAddX.jsx' for X in ['Adjective', 'Noun', 'Verb']
	- Make a list of inputs and render them using .map() somehow
- SearchCard.jsx:54 handle properly "Proxy error" message
- Continue implementing additional languages and features
