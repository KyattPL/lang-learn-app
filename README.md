# Language Learning App
Super simple language flashcards app (less refined than "flashcards" repo)

# TODO:
- Clear the form after adding a new card
	- Possibly redirect to the homepage or sth
	- Show a modal informing that new card has been added
- Add "Delete" button to delete cards from the database
- Fix responsiveness when it comes to certain parts of forms
- Delete or do something with the search input at the navbar

- Continue implementing additional languages and features
